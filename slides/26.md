## The proper separation of concerns is between components, not technologies

- Everything you need to know about a component is in one module
- Unidirectional data flow is predictable, easy to follow
  - Data comes from the owner
- No cascading events, no querying the DOM
  - But you can if you want to using lifecycle methods
