### DOM is abstracted away completely

- Synthetic event system
- `components !== domElements`
  - Use components for [routing](https://github.com/rackt/react-router), or for [side-loading data](https://github.com/acdlite/flummox/blob/master/docs/api/FluxComponent.md).
- Use React in non-browser environments
  - Server-side rendering
  - React Native (!!!)
